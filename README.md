# JavaFX ISP Package Manager
This is quite a simple desktop app which utilizes the JavaFX package for GUI creation, though I definitely prefer working in Swing over this.

It also utilizes Hibernate as an ORM and Maven as a dependancy manager/build tool.

The project was once again a part of the ITAcademy curriculum and is similar to 2 of my previous projects [JDBC_EMS](https://github.com/lxdain/JDBC_EMS/) & [Hibernate_EMS](https://github.com/lxdain/Hibernate_EMS/).

```xml
<VBox alignment="CENTER" spacing="20.0" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml"
      fx:controller="com.lxdain.fx.Controller">
    <padding>
        <Insets bottom="20.0" left="20.0" right="20.0" top="20.0"/>
    </padding>

    <Label text="Internet Package Registration"/>
...
```

Definitely not my cup of tea.
